We are creating a form or definition of a limit for the average and instantaneous rates of change at a point
	- Average Rate of Change
		- ( Difference Quotient ) For Average rate of change of function [f(x)](tex://f(x)) over interval [[a, x]](tex://[a, x]) is [\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}](tex://\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a} ) 
		- Slope of secant line over an interval
	- Instantaneous Rate of Change
		- For Instantaneous rate of change of function [f(x)](tex://f(x)) at [x = a](tex://x = a) is [lim_{x \rightarrow a}  \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}](tex://lim_{x \rightarrow a}  \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}) or [lim_{h \rightarrow 0}  \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a}](tex://lim_{h \rightarrow 0}  \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a})
		- Slope of tangent line at a point
	-  Example:


> 	The altitude of Estelle's helicopter is given by E(t), equation provided above. E(t) is measured in feet, and time t is measured in minutes after takeoff.

> 		- (a) What is the average rate of change of Estelle's helicopter altitude over the interval 5 ≤ t ≤ 20? Indicate units of measure.
> 	Average rate of change = [\frac{E(20)-E(5)}{20-5} = \frac{13600-4225}{20-5} \frac{ft}{min}](tex://\frac{E(20)-E(5)}{20-5} = \frac{13600-4225}{20-5} \frac{ft}{min}) [\leftarrow](tex://\leftarrow)( You don't need to simplify this further, leading to wrong simplification will lead to losing points)

> 		- (b) Write an expression involving a limit for the instantaneous rate of change of Estelle's helicopter altitude at time t = 7.
> 	Instantaneous rate of change: [lim_{ t \rightarrow 7} \frac{E(t)-E(7)}{t-7} = \frac{(-11t^2 +900t)-(-11(7)^2+900(7))}{t-7}](tex://lim_{ t \rightarrow 7} \frac{E(t)-E(7)}{t-7} = \frac{(-11t^2 +900t)-(-11(7)^2+900(7))}{t-7})
