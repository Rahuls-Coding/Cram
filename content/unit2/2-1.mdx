We are creating a form or definition of a limit for the average and instantaneous rates of change at a point
<br/>
Average Rate of Change:
 ( Difference Quotient ) For Average rate of change of function $f(x)$ over interval $[a, x]$ is $\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}$
- Slope of secant line over an interval
- Instantaneous Rate of Change:
- - For Instantaneous rate of change of function $f(x)$ at $x = a $ is $lim_{x \rightarrow a}  \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$  or $lim_{h \rightarrow 0}  \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a}4$
- Slope of tangent line at a point
<br/>
Example:

<br/>
The altitude of Estelle's helicopter is given by E(t), equation provided above. E(t) is measured in feet, and time t is measured in minutes after takeoff.
<br/>
(a) What is the average rate of change of Estelle's helicopter altitude over the interval 5 ≤ t ≤ 20? Indicate units of measure.
Average rate of change = $\frac{E(20)-E(5)}{20-5} = \frac{13600-4225}{20-5} \frac{ft}{min}$ $\leftarrow$( You don't need to simplify this further, leading to wrong simplification will lead to losing points)
<br/>
(b) Write an expression involving a limit for the instantaneous rate of change of Estelle's helicopter altitude at time t = 7.
Instantaneous rate of change: $ lim_{ t \rightarrow 7} \frac{E(t)-E(7)}{t-7} = \frac{(-11t^2 +900t)-(-11(7)^2+900(7))}{t-7} $
