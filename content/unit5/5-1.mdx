  If a continuous on the close interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b), then there exists a number c (a, b) such that, $ f\prime(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} $
 There will be two parallel lines, one through (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)), and the other tangent to the curve f(x) at the point (c, f(c)).

To solve a problem, you first have to determine the value of/solve for $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ and then we have the find $f\prime(x)$, once we have both of those things we make it equal to each other and the solve for x and that x value is your c value. 
For example:
- Determine if the MVT applies to $f(x) = 3-\frac{5}{x}$ on the interval [1,5]. If the theorem does apply, find the value of c guaranteed by the theorem. 
- To answer this question we know the function is continuous **on the interval [1,5]**, and we know it's also differentiable **on the interval (1,5)**, so it meets both requirements 
- As mentioned earlier we have to solve for  $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ so,  $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} =  \frac{(3-\frac{5}{5})-(3-\frac{5}{1})}{5-1} = 1$
- Then we have to solve for $f\prime (x)$, which is $f\prime (x) = \frac{5}{x^2}$ 
- Now we have to make it equal to each and solve for x, $\frac{5}{x^2} = 1$, $x= \pm \sqrt5$, and that is the c value.
