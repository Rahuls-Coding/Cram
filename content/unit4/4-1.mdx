Interpret the meaning of the derivative based on the context of the problem.
<BulletPoints heading='Using NUT' points={['Noun/Number', 'Units', 'Time']} />

 Example: Grass clippings are placed in a bin, where they decompose. For 0 St 530,
the amount of clippings remaining in the bin is modeled by A(t) = 6.687(0.931)',
where A(t) is measured in pounds and t is measured in days.

<br/>
- a.) Find the average rate of change of A(t) over the interval $0 < t < 30$. Indicate the units of measurement. **Answer: -0.197 pounds per day**
<br/>
- b.) Find the value of A'(15). Using correct units, interpret the meaning of the value in the context of the problem. **Answer:  A'(15) = -0.164 lbs/day Means that the amount of grass clippings is decreasing of an instantaneous rate of 0.164 pounds per day at 15 days.**
