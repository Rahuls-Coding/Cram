<BulletPoints heading='Motion' points={[`s(t) = Position`, "v(t) = s'(t) = Velocity", "a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t) = Acceleration"]} />


What this means is, if s(t) is represented by position then the first derivative of position would be velocity, $ s(t) = v^\prime(t) $. The second derivative of position (or the first derivative of velocity) would be acceleration, $ s^{\prime\prime}(t) = v^\prime(t) = a(t) $.

In terms of speed of the object/person in question, we can use the infomoration below to guide us.

<BulletPoints heading="Speed" points={['v(t) and a(t) have same signs - speeding up', 'v(t) and a(t) have different signs - slowing down', 'v(t) = 0, stopped, a(t) = 0, constant speed' ]}/>
